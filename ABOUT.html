								<p>I was born and raised in San Francisco, CA, and my professional journey has been defined by adaptability, creativity, and a passion for problem-solving. After graduating from St. Ignatius College Preparatory, I gained early experience in customer service and hospitality while studying at City College of San Francisco. These roles taught me the value of teamwork, clear communication, and delivering consistent results in fast-paced environments.

</p>
<p>In 2017, I transitioned into real estate staging with AMI Staging, where I worked as a lead stager managing projects and coordinating with clients. During this time, I attended San Francisco State University. Later, at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, I advanced to head barback and service bartender, overseeing inventory and operations in a demanding hospitality setting. These experiences strengthened my organizational and leadership skills, as well as my ability to collaborate across diverse teams.

</p>
<p>In 2021, I moved to Japan to build a life with my wife and began working as an English teacher. Over the past four years, I have worked in both private and public schools, teaching students of various ages and adapting my methods to different learning environments. As an Assistant Language Teacher in Fukuoka, I have been responsible for engaging hundreds of students across multiple schools, further developing my communication, adaptability, and cross-cultural collaboration skills.

</p>
<p>Alongside teaching, I discovered a strong interest in data-driven problem solving. To pursue this, I completed the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate through Coursera and earned the Data Analyst Associate Certificate in SQL with DataCamp. I am now building a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my ability to analyze data, identify insights, and communicate results through clear visuals and storytelling.

</p>
<p>My career goal is to transition into data analytics, where I can leverage my diverse professional background, teaching experience, and growing technical skills to contribute to meaningful projects. I bring creativity, persistence, and a global perspective — qualities shaped by my experiences in education, hospitality, and the arts.

</p>
<p>Outside of work, I enjoy music, film, hiking, trail running, and scuba diving — creative and outdoor pursuits that keep me curious and energized.</p>
